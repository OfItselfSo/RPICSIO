<h2>About the SPIPort Class</h2>
<P>
The SPIPort class writes to and reads from the SPI bus On Chip Peripheral (OCP) device integrated into the Raspberry Pi 2 CPU. 
In the Linux operating system there are two ways of accessing the SPI devices; the first, called SPIDev, is the 
standard and approved Linux technique. SPIDev is a device driver and if the existence of a SPI port is detected during boot time,
the device driver interface will be exposed as a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory of the Raspberry Pi file system. The
SPI ports will only be detected if that port is appropriately configured (using <code>raspi-config</code>). 
<P>
The second type of access is called Memory Mapped access and this treats the Raspberry Pi's RAM memory as if it were a file. The SPI port is manipulated as if
it were a bit at an offset in a virtual file. The RPICSIO library does not, at this time, provide a class which utilizes Memory Mapped access
to the SPI port - the file system based SPIDev class named <a href="RPICSIOHelp_SPIPortFS.html">SPIPortFS</a> is the only one available.
<P>
There is one SPI port on a Raspberry Pi 2. If this port has been correctly configured (using <code>raspi-config</code>), the SPIDev device driver for that port will be accessible via a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory. This file will have names in the format <code>spidev&lt;spiport&gt;.&lt;ssline&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;spiport&gt</code> is the number of the spi port and the <code>&lt;ssline&gt;</code> is the number of the slave select (also known as the chip select) line. 
Thus the file <code>/dev/spidev0.1</code> is the interface for the SPIDev device driver on SPI port 0 and slave select line 1. If you do not see the <code>spidev*</code> file
in the <code>/dev</code> directory this means that the SPI device is not correctly configured. By the way, these files are not the sort of files you
can open and write text to in order control the port (like you do with the SYSFS GPIO subsystem). The spidev files are true device files and if you want them to do anything 
you have to use an <code>ioctl()</code> call.
<P>
Each device on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus">SPI bus</a> has its own enable/disable line called the Slave Select (or sometimes Chip Select) line and the Raspberry Pi functions as the SPI bus master. The SPI device on the Raspberry Pi can control up to 2 Slave Select lines. Effectively this means that, using the SPI ports dedicated slave select lines, it is only possible to have 2 slave devices per SPI port.  However, not to worry, the SPIPortFS class has additional functionality which enables GPIO ports to be used as slave select lines and hence quite a large number of SPI bus devices are possible. 
<P>
Please note that with the <a href="RPICSIOHelp_SPIPortFS.html">SPIPortFS</a> class you cannot mix and match GPIO based chip select lines and the SPI ports dedicated chip select lines. If you use one GPIO based slave select line, then all lines must be GPIO based on that port. This is because the chip select lines are tied to the SPIDev device file. Once the spidev* file is opened (and it needs to be in order to write anything at all to the device) 
the SPI port will always activate the dedicated chip select line for each write and there is no way to stop it doing this. The best
you can do is ignore the dedicated chip select line (by leaving it unconnected and floating electrically) and using the GPIO based slave selects to activate each device. 
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
The SPI port used in the examples below is SPI0 - this must be configured in order for it to be available for use.
<P>
The first example code below uses the dedicated <code>SPI_SLAVEDEVICE_CS0</code> as the chip select line and this appears on the header on pin 24. The second example code below uses GPIOs 4 and 17 as chip select lines which are exposed as pin 7 and 11 on the RPi 2's header. 
<P>
When using a GPIO as a slave select line on any SPIPort class, the GPIO will be configured as an output in exactly
the same way as if you were going to use them with one of the <a href="RPICSIOHelp_OutputPortExample.html">OutputPort</a> classes. You do not need to take any action to configure this - it is all done internally. 
<P>
The <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/RBerrySharp/InstallingRaspbianKernelRaspberryPi.php">Raspbian Linux</a> running on the Raspberry Pi is <font color="red">not a real-time operating system</font>. However, an OCP peripheral such as
the SPIPort has its own internal clock and so, once the information is given to the port, it will be transmitted and received
at the configured port speed with no interruptions. However, transfers made via multiple calls to the SPI port can, and will, have variable gaps 
between transmissions as the process is pre-emptively swapped in and out by the kernel.
<P>
Also note it is possible to set the transmission speed for the SPI Port as a default on the port and also to specifically override that speed individually for a
slave device. For the <a href="RPICSIOHelp_SPIPortFS.html">SPIPortFS</a> class it is much faster, by a factor of about 10, to set the port speed on the port and let the slave device use it as a default than to set it
individually on each device. This is true even if the slave device speed is set to the exact same speed as the global SPI port default value. There is something 
in the SPIDev device driver that has to activate internally on each transmission (one or more ioctl() calls probably) to override the SPI port default speed
for an individual device and this is time consuming. It is far better to set the speed on the SPI port rather than the slave device unless you really need
to have different speeds for each device.
<P>
<font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTE:</font> Before creating any <a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/RPICSIO/RPICSIO.php">RPICSIO</a> Port class you will need to ensure 
that the RPICSIO Library knows which type of Raspberry Pi you are dealing with. This is done by executing a call (only once is necessary) like the one below somewhere 
in your code before you create any port.

There are two examples below. The <a href="#Example1">first</a> shows a write and read from a SPI slave device using the internal CS0 line. The <a href="#Example2">second example</a> illustrates the use of two GPIO
base slave select lines to control two different SPI slave devices.
