<h2>About the I2CPort Class</h2>
<P>
The I2CPort class writes to and reads from the I2C bus On Chip Peripheral (OCP) device integrated into the Raspberry Pi 2 CPU. 
In the Linux operating system there are two ways of accessing the I2C devices; the first, called I2CDev, is the 
standard and approved Linux technique. I2CDev is a device driver and if the existence of a I2C port is detected during boot time,
the device driver interface will be exposed as a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory of the Raspberry Pi file system. The
I2C ports will only be detected if that port is appropriately configured. 
<P>
The second type of access is called Memory Mapped access and this treats the Raspberry Pi's RAM memory as if it were a file. The I2C port is manipulated as if
it were a bit at an offset in a virtual file. The RPICSIO library does not, at this time, provide a class which utilizes Memory Mapped access
to the I2C port - the file system based I2CDev class named <a href="RPICSIOHelp_I2CPortFS.html">I2CPortFS</a> is the only one available.
<P>
There is one I2C port available by default on a Raspberry Pi 2. The I2C device will need to be enabled before it can be used and this is done using the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md">raspi-config</a> utility. If this port has been correctly configured, the I2CDev device driver for that port will be accessible
via a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory. This file will have a name in the format <code>i2cdev_&lt;i2cport&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;i2cport&gt</code> is
the number of the I2C port. Thus the file <code>/dev/i2cdev_1</code> is the interface for the I2CDev device driver on I2C port 1. If you do not see the <code>i2cdev_*</code> file
in the <code>/dev</code> directory this means that the I2C device is not correctly enabled. By the way, these files are not the sort of files you
can open and write text to in order control the port (like you do with the SYSFS GPIO subsystem). The <code>i2cdev</code> files are true device files and if you want them to do anything 
you have to use an <code>ioctl()</code> call.
<P>
Each device on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2C">I2C bus</a> has its own address called the device address and the Raspberry Pi functions as the I2C bus master.
You should use the free <a href="http://elinux.org/Interfacing_with_I2C_Devices#i2c-tools">i2c-tools</a> package to probe the Raspberry Pi for all available I2C ports and also to 
probe for the addresses of the devices addresses connected to a particular I2C port. The use of the i2c-tools will not be discussed here - however Adafruit 
has posted a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c">useful page</a> which, in part, covers that subject.
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
The I2C port used in the examples below is I2C1 - this must be configured in order for it to be available for use. 
<P>
The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Linux</a> running on the Raspberry Pi is <font color="red">not a real-time operating system</font>. However, an OCP peripheral such as
the I2CPort has its own internal clock and so, once the information is given to the port, it will be transmitted and received
at the configured port speed with no interruptions. However, transfers made via multiple calls to the I2C port can, and will, have variable gaps 
between transmissions as the process is pre-emptively swapped in and out by the kernel.
<P>
<font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTE:</font> Before creating any <a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/RPICSIO/RPICSIO.php">RPICSIO</a> Port class you will need to ensure 
that the RPICSIO Library knows which type of Raspberry Pi you are dealing with. This is done by executing a call (only once is necessary) like the one below somewhere 
in your code before you create any port. 
<PRE>
            RPICSIOConfig.Instance.RPIType = RPITypeEnum.RPITYPE_RPI2;

<h2>An Example of the I2CPort Usage</h2>
<P>
The code below illustrates how to use the I2CPortFS class to read from an I2C device (an ADC) and then write that value to another I2C device (an 4x7 Segment display) on the same I2C bus.

        /// Writes to and reads from an I2C port - I2CDev version. The example code
        /// assumes there are two I2C devices on the bus. A Sparkfun Serial 7 
        /// Segment Display on I2C address 0x71 and an AdaFruit 12-Bit 4 Channel ADC
        /// with Programmable Gain Amplifier on I2C address 0x48.
        /// 
        /// NOTE: 
        ///   The address of the device is specified in the i2cPort.Write or
        ///   i2cPort.Read calls. You do not need to send that as the first outgoing
        ///   byte or set the READ/WRITE bit in that address. The I2C driver does
        ///   that for you automatically.

In the above code, the <code>i2cID</code> is passed in when the function was called. This value is a member of the 
<code><a href="RPICSIOHelp_I2CPortEnum.html">I2CPortEnum class</a></code> which lists all possible I2C ports which
can be present on the Raspberry Pi. The above code is called via a line which looks like:
<pre>
I2CPortFSTest(I2CPortEnum.I2CPORT_1);
