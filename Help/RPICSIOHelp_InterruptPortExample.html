<h2>About the InterruptPort classes</h2>
<P>
The InterruptPortMM class is designed to send an .NET event to a subscriber when the state (high or low) of a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi changes. 
The RPICSIO library usually provides classes for both SYSFS and Memory Mapped access however the InterruptPort functionality is only available in 
MemoryMapped mode.
<P>
The InterruptPortMM class automatically configures the GPIO as an input in exactly the same way as a normal InputPort. Note that you will need to configure
pull-up and pull-down resistors on the port in exactly the same way as the InputPort classes. 
<P>
The example code below uses a GPIO value of 4 which is exposed as pin 7 on the header. In general, on the Raspberry Pi 2, these GPIOs are available for input or output by default. However it is possible to adjust the pinmux with the device tree to use header pins for alternate devices. If you are messing about with the Device
Tree you will probably know what you have configured specific pins to use.
<P>
The GPIOs themselves can be either outputs or inputs and it is possible to configure internal pull-up or pull-down resistors on an input. The act of creating an RPICSIO InterruptPort class on a GPIO will configure it as an input. However, you will need to configure the pull-up or pull-down resistors as required. The InterruptPort class has function calls for this purpose.  
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
Always be aware that the Raspbian Linux running on the Raspberry Pi is <font color="red">not a real-time operating system</font>. This means, for example, although you might set up an InterruptPort object to trigger on a the state change of a GPIO, the actual timing of some of the events may vary (and there may be lengthy gaps) as the process is pre-emptively swapped in and out by the kernel.
<P>
Be aware of the RPI max input voltage (3.3v) and pullup/pulldown resistors. Be really careful about the voltage you provide here. In general it 
is usually a good idea to run the input through some sort of buffer to clamp the max input at the RPI maximum.
<P>
This is not a true real-time interrupt. It has a lot more in common with a C language poll() call. Please see the comments on the <a href="RPICSIOHelp_InterruptPortMM.html">InteruptPortMM</a> documentation for notes on its method of operation.
<P>
<font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTE:</font> Before creating any <a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/RPICSIO/RPICSIO.php">RPICSIO</a> Port class you will need to ensure 
that the RPICSIO Library knows which type of Raspberry Pi you are dealing with. This is done by executing a call (only once is necessary) like the one below somewhere 
in your code before you create any port. 
<PRE>
            RPICSIOConfig.Instance.RPIType = RPITypeEnum.RPITYPE_RPI2;
</PRE>

<h2>An Example of the InterruptPort Usage</h2>
<P>
The code below illustrates how to use the InterruptPortMM class to monitor the state of a GPIO pin and send an event to a remote method (which can
be in an entirely different class). The example interrupt handler simply outputs a summary of the event to the console.
<pre>

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Creates and monitors an interrupt port.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// 
        /// NOTE:
        ///    Be aware of the RPi max input voltage and pullup/pulldown resistors. 
        ///    Interrupt or not it the pin is still an input. Be really careful about 
        ///    the voltage you provide here. In general it is usually a good idea to 
        ///    run the input through some sort of buffer to cap the max input at the 
        ///    RPi maximum.

        ///    this is not a true interrupt. It has a lot more in common with a C 
        ///    language poll() call.
        /// 
        /// STANDARD NOTE:
        ///   Be aware that you have to tell RPICSIO what type of Pi you are using. This
        ///   is done by issuing the call below somewhere before you open any port. It
        ///   only needs to be done once (replace the '2' with a 3 or 0 as appropriate).
        /// 
        ///   RPICSIOConfig.Instance.RPIType = RPITypeEnum.RPITYPE_RPI2;
        /// 
        /// SIMPLE Test Harness
        ///   connect a wire to GPIO_4 (pin 7)
        /// 
        ///   Once you have done that the issue a call like
        ///     SimpleInterruptPortMM(GpioEnum.GPIO_4, InterruptMode.InterruptRisingEdgeTransient);
        ///   
        ///     then ground the wire by touching it to pin 39. This should generate a
        ///     output on the screen indicating the ground has happened. The events appear
        ///     in a call to the IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt code below. Note, usually a lot of
        ///     events will be triggered because such a simple test system has no debouncing.
        ///
        /// &lt;param name="eventInterruptModeIn"&gt;The interrupt mode&lt;/param&gt;
        /// &lt;param name="gpioIn"&gt;The gpio this port represents. &lt;/param&gt;
        /// &lt;history&gt;
        ///    01 Dec 16  Cynic - Originally written
        /// &lt;/history&gt;
        public void SimpleInterruptPortMM(GpioEnum gpioIn, InterruptMode eventInterruptModeIn)
        {
            if (gpioIn == GpioEnum.GPIO_NONE)
            {
                throw new Exception ("Bad interrupt port GpioEnum.GPIO_NONE");
            }

            // create an interrupt port.
            InterruptPortMM ipPortGPIO = new InterruptPortMM(gpioIn, GPIOPullUpDownModeEnum.PULLUPDOWN_UP, eventInterruptModeIn);
            // Hook up an event handler to the OnInterrupt event 
            // the IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt function will receive the incoming event data
            ipPortGPIO.OnInterrupt += new InterruptEventHandlerMM(IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt);
            // we will not get any data if it is not enabled
            ipPortGPIO.EnableInterrupt();
            // run until we get key press on the console
            while (Console.KeyAvailable == false)
            {
                // sleep for a second
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
            // this just stops all transmissions. The interrupt can be enabled again
            // NOTE: disabling the interrupt does not release the event resources
            ipPortGPIO.DisableInterrupt();
            // close the port
            ipPortGPIO.ClosePort();
            // usually a good idea to dispose()
            ipPortGPIO.Dispose();
            // we never can use this object again after it is disposed. To use it
            // again we would have to re-create it
            ipPortGPIO = null;
        }
</pre> 

The above code subscribes to the InterruptPort's OnInterrupt event and any events will appear in the named
<code>IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt</code> handler. Example code for the <code>IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt</code> handler is given below. You can
route more than one InterruptPort to the same handler - however to do anything useful you will need to 
use the information passed in during the event to figure out which event was triggered.
<P>
Note that the code below <font color="red">executes in a different thread</font> than the one in which the InterruptPortMM was
created. You should not do any lengthy processing in the interrupt handler thread as no other interrupts can be processed
until the current interrupt is cleared.

In the <code>SimpleInterruptPortMM</code> call, the <code>gpioID</code> and <code>eventInterruptModeIn</code> are passed in when the function was called. 
These values are members of the 
<code><a href="RPICSIOHelp_GPIOEnum.html">GpioEnum</a></code> and <code><a href="RPICSIOHelp_InterruptMode.html">InterruptMode</a></code> enumerations.
The called would be made via a line which looks like:
<pre>
SimpleInterruptPortMM(GpioEnum.GPIO_4, InterruptMode.InterruptRisingEdgeTransient);
