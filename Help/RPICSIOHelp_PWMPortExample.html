<h2>About the PWMPort Class</h2>
<P>
The PWMPort class controls one of the two Pulse Width Modulation On Chip Peripheral (OCP) outputs integrated into the Raspberry Pi 2 CPU. 
In the Linux operating system there are two ways of accessing the PWM devices. The first, file system access using device drivers, is the 
standard and approved Linux technique. If the existence of a PWM port is detected during boot time, the PWM device driver interface will be exposed as files in the <code>/sys/class/pwm</code> directory of the Raspberry Pi file system. The PWM ports will only be detected if that port is appropriately configured.
<P>
The second type of access is called Memory Mapped access and this treats the Raspberry Pi's RAM memory as if it were a file. The PWM port is manipulated as if
it were a bit at an offset in a virtual file. The RPICSIO library does not, at this time, provide a class which utilizes Memory Mapped access
to the PWM port - the file system based class named <a href="RPICSIOHelp_PWMPortFS.html">PWMPortFS</a> is the only one available.
<P>
There are several possible pins on the Raspberry Pi 2 header which could, theoretically, output PWM signals. The actual pin used depends on the options appended to the device tree overlay when it is executed. If you use the device tree overlay configuration as advised below, the default pins will be Pin12 for PWM_0 and Pin35 for PWM_1;
<P>
A listing of all PWM Devices and their P8/P9 Headers is given below
<P>
<pre>
        PWM_0,       // output pin depends on dt_overlay
                     //    GPIO_18, header Pin12 by default
        PWM_1,       // output pin depends on dt_overlay       
                     //    GPIO_19, header Pin35 by default
</pre>
<P>
See the comments in the example code below for an explanation of the meaning of the above table.

<h2>Enabling the PWM Ports</h2>
<P>
There is a bit of a problem with the RPi's PWM ports the Raspbian operating system, (at the time this documentation was written), has an incorrect set of device tree overlays for the PWM ports. Theoretically, enabling the PWM ports should be as simple as including either one of the lines below in the <Code>/boot/config.txt</Code> file.
<pre>
    # enable one PWM with GPIO_18, header Pin12 by default
    dtoverlay=pwm.dtbo
    # enable two PWMs GPIO_18, header Pin12 and GPIO_19, header Pin35 by default
    dtoverlay=pwm-2chan.dtbo
</pre>
Unfortunately, the above lines do not work correctly. These device tree configuration overlays create the proper devices in the <code>/sys/class/pwm</code> directory but they omit to enable a hardware clock deep down in the OCP subsystem. With these overlays, the PWM devices simply will not work and they will not throw an error either. Fortunately, the clever people at JumpNowTek.com have come up with a much better device tree configuration file which does enable the appropriate clock. The source code for the overlays is available for download from this page <a href="http://www.jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Using-the-Raspberry-Pi-Hardware-PWM-timers.html">http://www.jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Using-the-Raspberry-Pi-Hardware-PWM-timers.html</a> and is also included in the RPICSIO source. 
<P>
Of course, to use the JumpNowTek device tree overlays you will need to compile them up. This is done with the following series of commands.
<UL>
<LI>Step 1: Check <Code>/boot/overlays</Code> for files with names of <Code>pwm-with-clk.dtbo</Code> and <Code>pwm-2chan-with-clk.dtbo</Code>. If you have these you do not need to download or compile anything - skip to Step 5 below.
<LI>Step 2: Ensure you have a device tree compiler. You can get this by issuing the command <Code>sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler</Code>. Probably you will already have one as the Raspbian operating system ships with this.
<LI>Step 3: Download the files from the following pages <a href="https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi/blob/krogoth/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-raspberrypi-4.4/dts/pwm-with-clk-overlay.dts">pwm-with-clk-overlay.dts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi/blob/krogoth/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-raspberrypi-4.4/dts/pwm-2chan-with-clk-overlay.dts">pwm-2chan-with-clk-overlay.dts</a> or dig them out of the RPICSIO source. Be sure to copy them into the <Code>/boot/overlays</Code> directory.
<LI>Step 4: Compile the overlays with commands like the following
<pre>
cd /boot/overlays
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o pwm-with-clk.dtbo pwm-with-clk-overlay.dts
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o pwm-2chan-with-clk.dtbo pwm-2chan-with-clk-overlay.dts
</pre>
At this point you should be able to confirm that the files <Code>pwm-with-clk.dtbo</Code> and <Code>pwm-2chan-with-clk.dtbo</Code> are present in the <Code>/boot/overlays</Code> directory.<LI>Step 5: Ensure the <Code>/boot/config.txt</Code> file contains one of the lines below.
<pre>
    # enable one PWM with GPIO_18, header Pin12 by default
    dtoverlay=pwm-2chan.dtbo
    # enable two PWMs GPIO_18, header Pin12 and GPIO_19, header Pin35 by default
    dtoverlay=pwm-2chan-2chan.dtbo
</pre>
<LI>Step 6: Reboot.
</UL>
<P>
Note that there are options available on the device tree overlays to route the PWM signal out to certain other pins on the RPi2's header. These are discussed on the <a href="http://www.jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Using-the-Raspberry-Pi-Hardware-PWM-timers.html">JumpNowTek page</a>, the defaults are as specified above. 
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
The PWM port used in the examples below is PWM_0. This signal will, by default, appear on Pin12 of the header (GPIO_18) although it can be routed out to other pins. You will need to check the device tree overlay setup in the <code>/boot/config.txt</code> file in order to confirm the pin being used.
<P>
Be aware that if you also use a second <a href="RPICSIOHelp_PWMPortFS.html">PWMPortFS</a> object on PWM_1 (pin35 by default) the frequency of the PWM port must be configured to be identical as they actually share a single internal PWM device. They can, however, have an independent duty cycle. 
<P>
Make sure you configure the duty cycle after you set the frequency on the port. The frequency is used to set the proper timings for the duty cycle and the duty cycle is not automatically adjusted if you change the base frequency of the PWM device.
<P>
You may also need to disable the audio - it has been rumoured to conflict with the PWM system. This is done by commenting out the line in the <code>config.txt</code> file as shown below:
<pre>
    #dtparam=audio=on
</pre>
<P>
The <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/RBerrySharp/InstallingRaspbianKernelRaspberryPi.php">Raspbian Linux</a> running on the Raspberry Pi is <font color="red">not a 
real-time operating system</font>. However, OCP peripherals such as
the PWM Devices have their own internal clock and so, once the frequency and duty cycle information is given to the port, that waveform will
maintained with no interruptions. However, the act of making changes to the configuration (the duty cycle - for example) can, and will, have variable timing 
as the process is pre-emotively swapped in and out by the kernel.
<P>
<font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTE:</font> Before creating any <a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/RPICSIO/RPICSIO.php">RPICSIO</a> Port class you will need to ensure 
that the RPICSIO Library knows which type of Raspberry Pi you are dealing with. This is done by executing a call (only once is necessary) like the one below somewhere 
in your code before you create any port. 
<PRE>
            RPICSIOConfig.Instance.RPIType = RPITypeEnum.RPITYPE_RPI2;
