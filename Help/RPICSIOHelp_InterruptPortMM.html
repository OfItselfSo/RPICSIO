<h2>The InterruptPortMM Class</h2>
<P>
The InterruptPortMM class is designed to monitor the state (high or low) of a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi and send an event through
a designated .NET delegate when the state changes to a pre-defined trigger level. All access is via a Memory Mapped access method. 
There is no version of this class which uses SYSFS access. 
<P>
These are not true interrupts. They have much more in common with
a polled event although the event will "interrupt" the Main() thread
and execute code in an object listening on them.
  
All GPIOs are associated with one of two banks. The act of creating 
an InterruptPort on a GPIO will start an event monitoring thread for 
that bank. This GPIO bank event monitoring thread is continuously 
computable and there is only one thread per bank. 
<P>
The InterruptPort registers with the GPIO bank event monitoring thread  
and when a pin state change of significance is detected the SendInterruptEvent
function in this class will be called. The SendInterruptEvent function
will place the relevant information into an <a href="RPICSIOHelp_EventData.html">EventData</a> object and then
send it on to anybody listening on the InterruptPorts <a href="RPICSIOHelp_InterruptEventHandlerMM.html">OnInterrupt delegate</a>
<P>
Be aware that the OnInterrupt handler method which accepts the data from 
the C# event is executing in the Gpio banks event monitoring thread 
- not the main() thread. You have to be careful what you do in there to 
avoid the many issues associated with multi-threaded applications. 
Also, it is not advisable to take too long to process the incoming event 
data - you cannot receive another interrupt while processing that one.
<P>
PRIORITYS: The GPIO bank event monitoring thread will detect changes
and then run down its list of registered InterruptPort until it finds
the correct one for that pin state change. The order of these registered
InterruptPorts is the Priority - highest first. Thus, if two pins change
state simultaneously then only one will get processed. If on a subsequent
pass the second interrupts pin state is still changed, it will get 
processed then. If it has changed back it will not be processed and the
interrupt event will be lost.
<P>
CLOSING DOWN: Be aware that a call to DisableInterrupt() does not stop 
the worker thread. You need to do an explicit ClosePort() call to stop 
the thread and release any resources the InterruptPort is using. Always 
explicitly Dispose() all ports when you are done with them. 
<P>
<font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTE:</font> Before creating any <a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/RPICSIO/RPICSIO.php">RPICSIO</a> Port class you will need to ensure 
that the RPICSIO Library knows which type of Raspberry Pi you are dealing with. This is done by executing a call (only once is necessary) like the one below somewhere 
in your code before you create any port.

<h3>Public Fields</h3>
<DL>
<P>
<code> public event <a href="RPICSIOHelp_InterruptEventHandlerMM.html">InterruptEventHandlerMM</a> OnInterrupt;</code>
<P>
<DL>
The event through which the InterruptPort class transmits the interrupt data to other objects. 
</DL>
<P>
</DL>

<P>
&nbsp;

<h3>Public Methods</h3>
<DL>
<P>
<code>public void ClearInterrupt()</code>

<DL>Clears the interrupt. Must be called after every interrupt before a new interrupt can be received.</DL>
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
<code>public override void ClosePort()</code>
<P>
<DL>Closes the port. Dispose() should subsequently be called to release resources. It is not possible to re-open a
closed InterruptPort - a new instance must be created.</DL>

&nbsp;
<P>
<code>public void DisableInterrupt()</code>
